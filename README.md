# 🌼✨ Hi there! I'm Edrielle ✨🌼

## 💛 Projects

Here are some things I’ve been working on lately:

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Home Fishie Home** | A cozy virtual aquarium where you clean, feed, and collect different rarities of fish! |
| **Pocket Postcards** | An interactive, pixel user exploration game where you can snap photos, change the background scenery, and turn your photos into written postcards. |

**Check out more in my repositories!**
<!--
**edri-mateo/edri-mateo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
